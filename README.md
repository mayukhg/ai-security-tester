# AI Security Testing Application

A comprehensive toolkit for testing the security vulnerabilities of AI models, including prompt injection, adversarial attacks, and other security assessments.

## Features

### 1. Prompt Injection Testing
- Direct injection attacks
- Indirect injection via context
- Role-playing attacks
- System prompt extraction

### 2. Adversarial Attack Testing
- Text-based adversarial examples
- Character-level perturbations
- Semantic attacks

### 3. Jailbreaking Attempts
- Common jailbreak patterns
- Creative bypass techniques
- Multi-turn conversation attacks

### 4. Data Extraction Testing
- Training data extraction attempts
- Personal information leakage
- Model parameter inference

### 5. Bias and Fairness Testing
- Demographic bias detection
- Stereotyping assessments
- Fairness metric evaluation

## Installation

```bash
# Clone or download the application
cd ai_security_tester

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python main.py --target-model "your_model_endpoint" --test-suite basic
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
python main.py --target-model "your_model_endpoint" --test-suite comprehensive --output-format json --save-results
```

### Configuration
Edit `config.yaml` to customize:
- Target model endpoints
- Test parameters
- Output formats
- Attack vectors to include/exclude

## Test Suites
